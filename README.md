### 🧰 Background Snapshot

- 10+ years in IT working with on-prem, virtualized environments
- Experience with Linux systems, networking, VMware, and storage (in both hands-on and design roles)
- Even caught the fever of FrontEnd Development and landed a job working with React, Tailwind, and Vitest 🤷‍♂️ 🤹‍♂️
- Recently worked in data migrations and scripting with APIs and Python for a SaaS company in 🇺🇸

### 🚀 Goals

- Become a **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** with expertise in automation and cloud-native tooling
- Progressively build skills in **DevOps**
